                The best racing teams don’t debate whether brakes slow them down.
                They know something deeper: brakes are what let you go fast in the first place.

                That’s the paradox of agent autonomy.
                Guardrails are not a limitation on autonomy — they’re the prerequisite for it.

                Aviation scaled autonomy by adding checklists, hard limits, and layered safety.
                Medicine made protocols standard because expertise alone isn’t enough under pressure.
                Organizations delegate power safely by creating budgets, approvals, audits, and reviews.

                But prompts are suggestions, not controls.
                When an agent has access to powerful tools, you eventually hit a ceiling.
                You can make failure less likely, but you can’t make it vanish.

                Production safety can’t be built out of suggestions alone.

                The best teams already add guardrails in Python:

                The problem isn’t that people don’t know guardrails matter.
                The problem is that when you assemble everything by convention across mismatched systems,
                it’s easy to miss a layer.

                This is the philosophy behind Tactus.
                Guardrails are not add-ons you bolt on later.
                They're architectural decisions baked into the execution model.

                No single technique solves everything.
                Guardrails work as defense in depth: layers that each reduce a different class of risk.

                Once you let an agent write files or run code, you want a cage.
                Tactus runs orchestration inside a sandboxed Lua environment,
                and when sandboxing is enabled, inside an ephemeral container.

                The broker boundary is the game changer.
                Keep the runtime secretless and networkless by default.
                The sandbox can request tool calls, but it never holds provider keys.
                The keys live outside the sandbox, in a trusted broker.
