                That’s the paradox of agent autonomy.
                Guardrails are not a limitation on autonomy — they’re part of what enable us to delegate responsibility.

            - voice: >
                This is the central tension in agent development today.
                If you want agents to do meaningful work without you watching every step — and if those agents can take real actions with side effects —
                guardrails stop being a nice-to-have. They become the price of admission.
                If agents can take real actions with side effects, “most of the time” isn’t a strategy.
                Start with a threat model: assets, entry points, trust boundaries, and enforceable controls.

                But prompts are suggestions, not controls.
                When an agent has access to powerful tools, you eventually hit a ceiling.
                You can make failure less likely, but you can’t eliminate it.  AI models are inherently stochastic, and sooner or later something will go sideways.

                Many teams already add guardrails in Python:

                The problem isn’t that people don’t know guardrails matter.
                The problem is that when you assemble everything by convention across mismatched systems,
                it’s easy to miss a layer.

                The broker boundary is the game changer.
                Keep the runtime secretless and networkless by default.
                The sandbox can request tool calls, but it never holds provider keys.
                The keys live outside the sandbox, in a trusted broker.

                This is the security model: don’t make secrets hard to steal—make sure there are no secrets inside the runtime to steal.
