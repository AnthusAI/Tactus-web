Hard quotas prevent runaway loops before they become billing nightmares.\n Prompt engineering. Structured instructions guide behavior and reduce error rates.\n Context engineering. Curated context ensures the model has the right information, not just all information.\n Model selection. Choose and fine-tune models for specific capabilities and safety profiles.\n Tool selection. Give the agent only the capabilities it needs, and stage access over time.\n Code sandboxing. Isolated execution environments prevent unauthorized system access.\n Container isolation. Ephemeral containers constrain what the runtime can touch and firewall side effects inside the container.",

The sandbox can request tool calls, but it never holds provider keys. The keys live outside the sandbox, in a trusted broker.\n This is the security model: don\u2019t make secrets hard to steal\u2014make sure there are no secrets inside the runtime to steal.
