Hard quotas prevent runaway loops before they become billing nightmares.\n Prompt engineering. Structured instructions guide behavior and reduce error rates.\n Context engineering. Curated context ensures the model has the right information, not just all information.\n Model selection. Choose and fine-tune models for specific capabilities and safety profiles.\n Tool boundaries. Strict schemas and validation at the edge where the agent touches the world.\n Code sandboxing. Isolated execution environments prevent unauthorized system access.\n Container isolation. Ephemeral containers ensure no state persists between runs.\n And at the foundation: a secretless broker. Credentials live outside the sandbox. The agent requests work but never holds the keys.",
