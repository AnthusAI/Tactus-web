If you miss a case, the program breaks.\n But tool\u2011using agents flip the script. Instead of explicitly handling every possible scenario, you depend on AI models to make decisions and take actions for you.\n In this new kind of programming, first you start with an AI agent, a language model.\n then you give it a tool.\n And then you assign it a procedure to follow,\n and you put guardrails around that, to guide it toward the goal.
