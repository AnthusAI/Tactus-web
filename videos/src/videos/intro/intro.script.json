Map these fields to those fields. If you miss a case, the program breaks.\n But tool\u2011using agents flip the script. Instead of explicitly handling every possible scenario, you describe what you want and give the agent the tools to do it.\n It\u2019s simple: you give an agent a tool, you give it a procedure to follow, and you put guardrails around it.\n What we need now is a new kind of programming language for this new kind of program.",

First, procedure code runs in a restricted Lua sandbox with limited capabilities.\n Second, that sandbox runs in a fresh container each time you run it.  Sort of like an AWS Lambda function.  The container can only see the folder you run the procedure from, and any other folder you explicitly share with it.  You can mount folders as read-only to prevent accidents.\n When the agent needs privileged work\u2014like calling an AI model provider or a credentialed API tool\u2014it does that throgh a broker that runs outside the sandbox.\n This way, the AI agents can't access your API keys or other sensitive data because it's all outside the sandbox and the container, both.  Your procedure code can use third-party APIs that require tokens or API keys without worrying about them being shared with AI companies or stolen through prompt injection hacks.",
