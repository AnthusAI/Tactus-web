Instead of explicitly handling every possible scenario, you define the procedure and let the agent work inside guardrails.\n In this new kind of programming, first you start with an AI agent, a language model.\n then you give it a tool.\n You assign it a procedure to follow,\n and you put guardrails around that, to guide it toward the goal.",

You can mount folders as read-only to prevent accidents.\n When the agent needs privileged work\u2014like calling an AI model provider or a credentialed API tool\u2014it does that throgh a broker that runs outside the sandbox.\n This way, the AI agents can't access your API keys or other sensitive data because it's all outside the sandbox and the container, both.
