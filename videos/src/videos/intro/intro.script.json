Instead of explicitly handling every possible scenario, you define the procedure and let the agent work inside guardrails.\n In this new kind of programming, first you start with an AI agent, a language model.\n then you give it a tool.\n You assign it a procedure to follow,\n and you put guardrails around that, to guide it toward the goal.",
