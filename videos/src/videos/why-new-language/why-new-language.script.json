          "text": "In the beginning, programmers wrote raw machine code. Zeros and ones. It was cumbersome, confusing, slow, and error-prone. And it was *low-level* in a very literal sense: those zeros and ones corresponded to physical states\u2014 voltage on a wire, a relay position, or a vacuum tube being on or off. Sometimes that meant wiring plugboards or toggling switches. Later it meant punching numeric opcodes. You were squinting down in the guts of the machine, and your \u201cprogram\u201d was basically a description of that machine.\n One practical mercy was hexadecimal notation. Hex wasn\u2019t invented for computers \u2014 it\u2019s ancient \u2014 but it became newly useful here. It didn\u2019t change what the computer executed, but it gave humans patterns and chunks they could recognize.\n Assemblers emerged almost immediately. Instead of binary opcodes, you could write symbolic instructions. Researchers formalized those patterns into names and labels, making \u201cmachine instructions\u201d legible to humans. The computer translated them into machine code. And once you can name things, you can reuse them: labels, macros, and early subroutines made programs repeatable instead of handcrafted.\n But the deeper shift is that assemblers introduced a two\u2011step workflow. Now there are two programs in the story: the assembler, and *your* program.\n You write code in a form that\u2019s easier for humans to understand. Then you run the assembler \u2014 a program \u2014 to turn that into machine code. And *then* the computer runs the machine code.\n That\u2019s the key step: one of the first useful things people ever did with computers was use them to make using computers easier. Even when computer time was precious, people spent some of it on tools that made programming faster, safer, and more repeatable.\n From there, the ladder of abstraction rose quickly. In the late 1950s and 1960s, early high-level languages like Fortran, Lisp, COBOL, ALGOL, and APL let humans describe problems more directly, while compilers handled the low-level details. Lisp, for example, was built for symbolic problems: lists, recursion, and treating code as data so you can transform programs like any other structure.\n One especially influential descendant of that era was C. It kept you close to the machine, but its constructs made repetition and reuse explicit: functions you could call again, and control flow you could reason about.\n C plus plus \u2014 and object-oriented programming more broadly \u2014 tried to match another problem space: large systems made of interacting \u201cthings\u201d with state and responsibilities.\n And languages like Ruby pushed toward expressing intent directly: code that reads closer to what a human means, so the computer does more of the bookkeeping.\n But through all of this, the paradigm never changed. The programmer still specified control flow. The computer still followed instructions.\n Today, we're seeing the same pattern repeat with AI. One of the first valuable uses of AI is to turn it on itself: using AI to make programming easier, and to write better code.\n Tactus continues that tradition. It raises the level of abstraction to match what engineers care about in agentic systems: procedures, tools, guardrails, checkpoints, and evaluation. So you can express those concerns directly.\n But this time, something deeper is changing. It's not just a higher level of abstraction. It's a fundamentally different way of making decisions.",

Instead of specifying every branch, you yield control to the AI model \u2014 and you surround that loop with guardrails.\n Even a basic guardrail matters immediately: you can\u2019t let the loop run forever.
